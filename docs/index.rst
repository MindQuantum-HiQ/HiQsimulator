.. title:: Overview

Huawei HiQ
==========

Huawei HiQ is an open-source software framework for quantum computing. It aims at providing tools which facilitate **inventing**, **implementing**, **testing**, **debugging**, and **running** quantum algorithms using either classical hardware or actual quantum devices.

#. **Open development system**: *Huawei HiQ is released under the* **Apache 2** *license. The framework is based on and compatible with open-source ProjectQ software and will continue to be open-source*
#. **Visualization scheme for classical-quantum hybrid programming**: *Unique quantum programming BlockUI makes classical-quantum hybrid programming easy and intuitive*
#. **Support of distributed and scalable hardware and software**: *The compilation framework supports multi-type of quantum hardware backends and Python/C++ API front-end extensions*
#. **Outstanding computational performance**: *Provides high-performance C++ parallel and distributed simulator backends*
#. **High-efficient resource management**: *Integrated high-performance optimizer for quantum circuit compiling to support finite internal RAMs and massively parallel computing*
#. **Support with rich algorithm library and help documents**: *Rich algorithm Library of important basic algorithms, accelerates the learning and development processes*
